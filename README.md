# Ephemera: Developing a Creative Practice Habit

## Description
A Full Stack Build Using Django and React

### Overview
Anyone starting a new habit, especially a creative writing endeavor, encounters a variety of obstacles. Ephemera is designed to help users overcome those obstacles and establish a daily creative practice. Writing haiku, due to its nature and brevity, serves as a great point of entry for sharpening our observations and initiating a creative practice. Each day, Ephemera provides a creative writing prompt and a classic haiku to inspire the user's original poem. The prompt facilitates greater attentiveness to the present moment, while the classic haiku serves as a model of those captured moments. The app also provides brief information about the art form's structure, content and history. Users can compose, save, and edit their own haikus all in one place. No more searching for random notebooks.
